    Dear Hiring Team,

    I’m excited to apply for this role at Datadog. I have 6 years of
    experience building reliable, observable distributed systems, with
    a focus on developer experience and platform stability. In my last
    role at Example Corp, I led the migration to a unified metrics
    pipeline and introduced tracing across key services, improving MTTR by 35%.

    I’d love to bring my skills in Python, TypeScript, and cloud-native
    observability to your team. Thank you for your time!

    Sincerely,
    Alex Parker
